## üéØ Customer Questions & Answers

### Q: "How secure is this?"
**A**: "It uses Microsoft's OAuth 2.0 authentication - the same security as Outlook itself. No credentials are stored in our system. Your IT team can revoke access anytime from the Azure portal."

**A**: "The AI confirms actions before executing them. Plus, all calendar operations can be undone manually in Outlook if needed. We also have comprehensive testing - 23 automated tests with 100% pass rate."

### Q: "Can it handle complex scheduling?"
**A**: "Yes - it understands multiple attendees, time zones, recurring meetings, and can work with existing calendar conflicts. Let me show you..."

### Q: "What's the setup process?"
**A**: "Your IT team needs about 15 minutes for initial Azure configuration. Then each user just signs in once. We provide complete setup documentation and support."

### Q: "What are the costs?"
**A**: "The Microsoft Graph API is free for standard usage. The AI processing costs about $0.25 per 1000 requests - typically under $5/month per heavy user."

### Q: "Can it integrate with our existing systems?"
**A**: "Absolutely. It provides REST APIs for integration, plus we can customize it for your specific workflows. It's built on enterprise-grade frameworks."
